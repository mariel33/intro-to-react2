Checkpoint 4
Exercise 1
`props` and `state` form the input data for the `render()` method in a component. They do similar things, but are used in different ways. Props are how components talk to each other and flow from parent to children. Props are immutable and should not change. State on the other hand is optional, and is used for mutable data. A component manages its own state internally and does not impact the state of its children. State is like a snapshot of one point in time.
